**Bahá’ís and their friends and families unite with one another in prayer. There are no rituals; no one individual has any special role. With reading prayers and passages from the Bahá’í sacred texts in an informal yet respectful atmosphere, a spirit of communal worship is generated by these simple gatherings, and this spirit begins to permeate the community’s collective endeavours.**
