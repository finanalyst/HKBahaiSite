[/center]
Under the stressing effect of negative social forces, junior youth need help in directing their new abilities towards selfless service to humanity during adolescence. The Bahá’í community and institutes offer to society “junior youth spiritual empowerment programs”, with creative activities to engage junior youth’s interests, mold their capacities for teaching and service, and assist them to transform their communities. The aim is to assist them to take ownership for their spiritual and intellectual development, to develop a strong sense of purpose, and the volition needed to make good decisions, and to engage in meaningful social action in communities.
