In a materialistic world, the moral and spiritual education of children assumes vital importance. The Bahá’í community and institutes offer to society children's classes with materials developed emphasizing the acquisition of spiritual qualities—for example, truthfulness, generosity, purity of heart, and kindness, etc. The goal of these classes is to reach a stage in which they can understand and act upon the imperative to tend to their own spiritual development and contribute to the well-being of society.
