[/center]
The Bahá’i training institutes maintain a system of education with one of the purposes to assist individuals to deepen their understanding of the Bahá’í teachings. A principal element of the system is "study circle", which is a small group of Bahá’is and friends who meet regularly to study course materials, grounded in the Bahá’í writings, covering topics, like life and death, children education, spiritual empowerment, consultation, etc. Participants come to recognize that they have the power to re-create the world around them and arise to serve. Capacity is gradually built in the community to reflect a pattern of life that places at its heart service and worship.
