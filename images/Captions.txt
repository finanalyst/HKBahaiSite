5560247 On the evening of May 22, Baha’is throughout the world commemorate the Declaration of the Báb, which took place in this room (pictured) in the Persian city of Shiraz in 1844.The Báb announced there that His mission was to alert the people to the imminent advent of Him Whom God shall make manifest, namely, Baha’u’llah, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith.The observance takes place about two hours after sunset. To mark the Holy Day, Baha’is abstain from work on 23 May.This year, the Holy Day occurs in the period when the elections of 178 National Spiritual Assemblies take place.The House of the Báb, where the Declaration occurred, was destroyed in 1979 during a wave of persecution that swept across the Baha’is in Iran following the Islamic revolution.
